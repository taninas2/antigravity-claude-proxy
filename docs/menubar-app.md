# macOS Menu Bar App

For macOS users who prefer a native experience, there's a companion menu bar app that provides quick access to server controls without touching the terminal. Get it from: [antigravity-claude-proxy-bar](https://github.com/IrvanFza/antigravity-claude-proxy-bar)

> **Note:** This is a GUI wrapper only. You still need to install and setup the proxy server first using one of the [installation methods](../README.md#installation) above.
